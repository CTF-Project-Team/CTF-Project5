    <h2>How the dinos died</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>We all know about the dinosaurs. They are creatures that walked the earth long ago, though nobody knows for sure how they died. Scientists have studied them for years, 
      but they still don't know how they died. There are multiple theories of course, such as the one where somebody says they died from the meteors that fell from the sky. </p>
