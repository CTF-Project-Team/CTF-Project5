        <h2>How the dinosaurs died</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Most people know about the dinosaurs. They are creatures that walked the earth long ago, though nobody knows for sure how they died. Scientists have studied them for years, 
          but they still don't know how they failed to survive. There are multiple theories of course, such as the one where somebody says they died from the meteors that fell 
          from the sky, but no one has proof so far about if the theory is actually true. This makes getting the true answer to how they actually died an extremely hard mission. </p>
