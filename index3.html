      <p>
        So we've learned that there are lots of theories about the how the Dinosaurs were wiped out.
        What could have killed such huge creatures that lived for millions and millions of years?
        One theory is that some scientists believe that a HUGE asteroid crashed into earth, setting off a
        series of events that sadly wiped out the dinosaurs. This happened over sixty five million years ago!!!

      <h2>What is an asteroid then?</h2>
      <p>
        So first of all, you are thinking, what is an asteroid? Let me tell you!
        <br />
        Asteroids are actually minor planets which can neither be classified either as a planet or as a
        comet. These are generally in the direct orbit around the Sun, also known as the inner solar system.
        The larger forms of asteroids are also known as planetoids. The name asteroid literally means "star-like".
