      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Most people know about the dinosaurs. They are powerful creatures that
        walked the world long ago, though no one know for sure how they died.
        This page is about some of the most well known theories of how the dinos died.

      <h2>The Asteroid Theory</h2>
      <p>
        The Asteroid Theory is a theory developed by scientists. They believe that
        a gigantic asteroid fell down from space, collided with earth's surface and
        cause such disruption that the sun was blocked and the climate was changed.

      <h2>The Volcano Theory</h2>
      <p>
        Other scientists believe that a volcano erupted and like the asteroid theory the debris
        covered up the sun and caused the climate to change.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        So far I've only given you two of the most well known theories about how the dinosaurs went
        extinct, though there are many, many more. Maybe it wasn't just one that caused the extinction.
        Maybe a lot of disasters happened at once, overwhelming the dinosaurs and killing them.
